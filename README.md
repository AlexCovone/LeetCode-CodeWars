## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript, TypeScript

The first thing I do every day is solve a CodeWars problem! Utilizing JavaScript, each problem presents a set of instructions that must be followed in pursuit of the desired solution.

## Optimizations
I consistently optimize my code for both readability and efficiency. 

## Lessons Learned:

Solving a problem every day allows me to be presented with a unique problem daily. Utilizing my skillset, I attempt to create a solution with the best methodologies. 

Whether I can solve the problem initially or not, I am constantly looking at the solution manual and explanations for alternative solutions in an effort to further my knowledge. Through this, I am able to learn new methodologies to implement in future projects and problems!
